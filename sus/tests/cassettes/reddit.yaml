        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would like to give
        you all an update on the recent issues that have transpired concerning a specific
        Reddit employee, as well as provide you with context into actions that we
        took to prevent doxxing and harassment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of today, the
        employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship
        with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did
        not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve
        put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment,
        and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on
        protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions.
        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;On March 9th, we added extra protections for
        this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee\u2019s
        name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve
        for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;On March
        22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of &lt;a href=&quot;/r/ukpolitics&quot;&gt;r/ukpolitics&lt;/a&gt;.
        The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules.
        When contacted by the moderators of &lt;a href=&quot;/r/ukpolitics&quot;&gt;r/ukpolitics&lt;/a&gt;,
        we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed
        the &lt;a href=&quot;/r/ukpolitics&quot;&gt;r/ukpolitics&lt;/a&gt; moderation
        team that we had restored the mod.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We updated our rules
        to flag potential harassment for human review.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Debate
        and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation
        on Reddit\u2014including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself\u2014as
        long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public
        figure\u2019s name should not get you banned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We care deeply
        for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion
        about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer
        with Reddit, and we\u2019ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We did not operate to our own standards here. We will do our best
        to do better for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32;

        we\u2019re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this
        year. Along with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/&quot;&gt;Up
        the Vote campaign&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/&quot;&gt;ongoing
        security and safety work&lt;/a&gt; to guard against shenanigans, we\u2019ve
        also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election
        process: &lt;strong&gt;political ads&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;First,
        some background&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Political ads have been a relatively quiet
        part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right
        balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether
        for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/&quot;&gt;a
        policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit&lt;/a&gt;: no misinformation,
        human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political
        ads (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/&quot;&gt;r/RedditPoliticalAds&lt;/a&gt;),
        and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since
        debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments
        to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads\u2014providing
        more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments\u2014but so
        far it\u2019s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however,
        the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and,
        with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;The problem we\u2019re addressing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&amp;amp;depth=2&quot;&gt;a
        couple months back&lt;/a&gt;, unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we
        want to improve, from Modmail to PM\u2019s, and political ads pose a unique
        challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign)
        moderates the comments, it\u2019s problematic: they might remove dissenting
        perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political
        ad, it\u2019s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either
        moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either
        way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see
        in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/announcements&quot;&gt;r/announcements&lt;/a&gt;: lots
        of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community.
        It\u2019s fair to say that &lt;a href=&quot;/r/announcements&quot;&gt;r/announcements&lt;/a&gt;
        isn\u2019t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation
        that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation
        has deteriorated as the audience has grown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately,
        conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither
        &lt;a href=&quot;/r/announcements&quot;&gt;r/announcements&lt;/a&gt; nor political
        ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion
        on both with a different approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What we\u2019re testing
        today&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments
        on the &lt;a href=&quot;/r/announcements&quot;&gt;r/announcements&lt;/a&gt;
        post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion
        of this post within other communities\u2014an approach we hope works for political
        ads as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below is a stickied comment with a link to
        submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion
        posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A few other details to note for this test:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
        discussion posts are like any other post&lt;/strong&gt;, which means they
        can be voted on by users and removed by mods.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communities
        that don\u2019t want to participate don\u2019t have to.&lt;/strong&gt; (If
        you\u2019re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this,
        you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/&quot;&gt;opt-out
        instructions&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual community
        rules apply to these posts just as any other&lt;/strong&gt;, so read the rules
        before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our stickied comment will link to discussions only
        from communities subject to our ads allow list.&lt;/strong&gt; Communities
        that have already opted not to appear in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/all&quot;&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;
        won\u2019t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of
        this post there.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After today\u2019s test,
        we will likely test this system with political ads.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This test will be a success if there are a variety of
        posts and conversations about this post, even\u2014and perhaps particularly\u2014if
        they are critical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How we\u2019re answering questions&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/announcements&quot;&gt;r/announcements&lt;/a&gt;
        posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs
        and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which
        I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult
        (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make
        you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don\u2019t
        intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/ModNews&quot;&gt;r/ModNews&lt;/a&gt;,
        &lt;a href=&quot;/r/changelog&quot;&gt;r/changelog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/ModSupport&quot;&gt;r/ModSupport&lt;/a&gt;,
        and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For today, we\u2019re going to make the first link of this post to
        &lt;a href=&quot;/r/ModNews&quot;&gt;r/ModNews&lt;/a&gt; and start by answering
        mods\u2019 questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific
        community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on
        what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion,
        like a regular AMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, I\u2019ll do my best
        to find other places to respond, and we\u2019ll maintain another comment below
        this post to list replies we\u2019ve given outside of &lt;a href=&quot;/r/announcements&quot;&gt;r/announcements&lt;/a&gt;
        so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from &lt;a
        href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/&quot;&gt;our
        post&lt;/a&gt; last week).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal of this
        test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations
        (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the
        way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information
        and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion
        well beyond the scope of the original post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for
        participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary
        not just today but down the road on political ads as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit (9/28/20):&lt;/strong&gt;
        Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score
        display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we\u2019ll be
        using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As
        I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions
        to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely
        optional for communities (opt-out instructions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),
        we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities
        and users on this test post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We\u2019re still exploring
        how we\u2019ll use this feature for &lt;a href=&quot;/r/announcements&quot;&gt;r/announcements&lt;/a&gt;
        posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about
        them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-overview&quot;&gt;Advertising

        work we discussed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We
        developed our enforcement plan&lt;/strong&gt;, including both our immediate
        actions (e.g., today\u2019s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the
        most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new
        policies, and advancing Reddit\u2019s community governance).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it\u2019s clear
        that while we\u2019ve gotten better in some areas\u2014like actioning violations
        at the community level, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/&quot;&gt;scaling
        enforcement efforts&lt;/a&gt;, measurably reducing hateful experiences like
        harassment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results&quot;&gt;year
        over year&lt;/a&gt;\u2014we still have a long way to go to address the gaps
        in our policies and enforcement to date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These include
        addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate
        speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and
        mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes,
        chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods
        and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it\u2019s our responsibility to support our communities
        by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit
        against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some
        of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely
        with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;New Policy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy&quot;&gt;new
        content policy&lt;/a&gt;. Here\u2019s what\u2019s different:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities,
        including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule 1&lt;/strong&gt; explicitly states that communities
        and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
        &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a
        violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or&quot;&gt;Help
        Center article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule
        2&lt;/strong&gt; ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with
        an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
        &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious
        attempts to interfere with other communities are not.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for
        clarity and inclusiveness.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alongside the change
        to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the
        vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt&quot;&gt;200&lt;/a&gt;
        have more than 10 daily users. Both &lt;a href=&quot;/r/The_Donald&quot;&gt;r/The_Donald&lt;/a&gt;
        and &lt;a href=&quot;/r/ChapoTrapHouse&quot;&gt;r/ChapoTrapHouse&lt;/a&gt;
        were included.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All communities on Reddit must abide by
        our content policy in good faith. We banned &lt;a href=&quot;/r/The_Donald&quot;&gt;r/The_Donald&lt;/a&gt;
        because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently
        hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized
        us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet
        our most basic expectations. Until now, we\u2019ve worked in good faith to
        help them preserve the community as a space for its users\u2014through warnings,
        mod changes, quarantining, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though smaller, &lt;a
        href=&quot;/r/ChapoTrapHouse&quot;&gt;r/ChapoTrapHouse&lt;/a&gt; was banned
        for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their
        mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit\u2014but
        all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without
        exception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Our commitment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our policies
        will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve
        them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community
        vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities
        than we as site admins or any AI ever could.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But just as
        our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you
        need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards
        this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive
        behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the
        way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit
        in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with
        today\u2019s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and
        are proud to be a part of for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit:
        After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article
        for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or&quot;&gt;Promoting

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:
        We\u2019re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address
        hate.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/u/kn0thing&quot;&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate,
        a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of
        our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end
        to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I
        wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this
        grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the
        color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it,
        a duty to speak out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I wrote an email
        to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond.
        When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \u201CHow can
        a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years
        credibly take such a position?\u201D&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These questions, which
        I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are
        really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people
        and a company, and what you see in our content policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over
        the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit
        for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\u2014across
        a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\u2019ve imagined when
        we first created subreddits\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations
        that keep people coming back day after day. It&amp;#39;s why we come to Reddit
        as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community
        and belonging to the world and make it better daily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However,
        as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges
        around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for
        the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance
        to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite
        the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to
        where we as administrators stand on racism. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Our moderators
        are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies
        that they help us enforce.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are already
        working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our
        current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy&quot;&gt;content
        policy&lt;/a&gt; is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit.
        In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful
        progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free
        expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work
        to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none
        of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate
        or racism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We will update our content policy to include
        a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate,
        the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used
        as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly,
        I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through
        our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks,
        not months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (&lt;a
        href=&quot;/u/kn0thing&quot;&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt;), my Reddit cofounder,
        announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat
        to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor.
        We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for
        us over the years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the risk of making this unreadably
        long, I&amp;#39;d like to take this moment to share how we got here in the
        first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions,
        we have fallen short.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006,
        our idealistic \u201Cpolicy\u201D was that, excluding spam, we would not remove
        content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal
        was tested, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3&quot;&gt;banned
        racist users&lt;/a&gt; anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs,
        despite our \u201Cpolicy.\u201D &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I left Reddit from 2010\u20132015.
        During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal
        policy &lt;a href=&quot;https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/&quot;&gt;ossified&lt;/a&gt;
        and its content policy took &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/&quot;&gt;no
        position on hate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I returned in 2015, my
        top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful
        communities I had been immediately confronted with (like &lt;a href=&quot;/r/CoonTown&quot;&gt;r/CoonTown&lt;/a&gt;,
        which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy
        of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/&quot;&gt;We
        banned that community and others&lt;/a&gt; because they were \u201Cmaking
        Reddit worse\u201D but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing
        hate. We crafted our &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy&quot;&gt;2015
        policy&lt;/a&gt; around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and
        objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition
        of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through
        continual updates to these policies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;,
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;,
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;,
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;
        (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful
        communities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While we dealt with many communities themselves,
        we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement
        and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/&quot;&gt;racism
        is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.
        This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness
        in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators
        and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with &lt;a
        href=&quot;/r/the_donald&quot;&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt;, a community that
        relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is
        now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies,
        \u201CBreaking Reddit\u201D was not a sufficient explanation for actioning
        a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in
        the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and
        racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf&quot;&gt;community-led
        approach is the only way to scale moderation online&lt;/a&gt;. That said,
        this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we
        need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility
        for this. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite making significant progress over the
        years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard
        work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies.
        This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or
        use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and
        we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I
        will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also
        know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 2020 election
        approaches, we are updating our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy&quot;&gt;policy
        on political advertising&lt;/a&gt; to better reflect the role Reddit plays
        in the political conversation and bring high quality political ads to Redditors.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a reminder, Reddit\u2019s advertising policy already forbids deceptive,
        untrue, or misleading advertising (political advertisers included). Further,
        each political ad is manually reviewed for messaging and creative content,
        we do not accept political ads from advertisers and candidates based outside
        the United States, and we only allow political ads at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That said, beginning today, we will &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; require
        political advertisers to work directly with our sales team and leave comments
        \u201Con\u201D for (at least) the first 24 hours of any given campaign. We
        will strongly encourage political advertisers to use this opportunity to engage
        directly with users in the comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In tandem, we are
        launching a subreddit dedicated to political ads transparency, which will
        list all political ad campaigns running on Reddit dating back to January 1,
        2019. In this community, you will find information on the individual advertiser,
        their targeting, impressions, and spend on a per-campaign basis. We plan to
        consistently update this subreddit as new political ads run on Reddit, so
        we can provide transparency into our political advertisers and the conversation
        their ad(s) inspires. If you would like to follow along, please subscribe
        to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/&quot;&gt;r/RedditPoliticalAds&lt;/a&gt;
        for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope this update will give you
        a chance to engage directly and transparently with political advertisers around
        important political issues, and provide a line of sight into the campaigns
        and political organizations seeking your attention. By requiring political
        advertisers to work closely with the Reddit Sales team, ensuring comments
        remain enabled for 24 hours, and establishing a political ads transparency
        subreddit, we believe we can better serve the Reddit ecosystem by spurring
        important conversation, enabling our users to provide their own feedback on
        political ads, and better protecting the community from inappropriate political
        ads, bad actors, and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please see the full
        updated political ads policy below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All political
        advertisements must be manually approved by Reddit. In order to be approved,
        the advertiser must be actively working with a Reddit Sales Representative
        (for more information on the managed sales process, please see \u201CAdvertising

        class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s been incredible to witness the
        ways in which the Reddit community has come together to raise awareness, share
        information and resources, and support each other during a time of universal
        need. Across the platform, existing communities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/science/&quot;&gt;r/science&lt;/a&gt;,
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/&quot;&gt;r/askscience&lt;/a&gt;,
        and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/&quot;&gt;r/worldnews&lt;/a&gt;
        have joined newly established communities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/&quot;&gt;r/Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;
        and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/&quot;&gt;r/COVID19&lt;/a&gt;
        to share authoritative content and welcome important discussion every day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At Reddit Inc., we\u2019ve also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt;
        to curate expert discussions and surface the most reliable information for
        you. And today, we\u2019re excited to launch the Solidarity Award, which seeks
        to raise funds for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19responsefund.org/&quot;&gt;COVID-19
        Solidarity Response Fund&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;World
        Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt;. The fund -- which is powered by the &lt;a
        href=&quot;https://unfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;United Nations Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
        and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swissphilanthropy.ch/en/&quot;&gt;Swiss
        Philanthropy Foundation&lt;/a&gt; -- supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;WHO\u2019s&lt;/a&gt;
        work to track and understand the spread of COVID-19, ensure patients get the
        care they need, frontline workers get essential supplies and information,
        and accelerate efforts to develop vaccines, tests, and treatments for the
        pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starting today, you can purchase the Solidarity
        Award directly on Reddit desktop and mobile web (via PayPal or Stripe), and
        &lt;strong&gt;100% of the proceeds&lt;/strong&gt; will benefit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid19responsefund.org/&quot;&gt;COVID-19
        Solidarity Response Fund&lt;/a&gt; for WHO.*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here
        are a few details on the Solidarity Award&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How to find the Award: The Solidarity Award can only be given on
        Reddit desktop and mobile web (not currently available to give on Mobile apps).
        You&amp;#39;ll find the award towards the bottom of the Medals section in
        our Award dialog. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The full price of the Award ($3.99)
        will be donated by Reddit to the United Nation Foundation\u2019s COVID-19
        Solidarity Response Fund for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/&quot;&gt;World
        Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. More information on the fund is available at
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.covid19responsefund.org/&quot;&gt;www.covid19responsefund.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Donors will receive a special Reddit Trophy, which will be added
        to users\u2019 trophy cases on their profile page (on or before 4/30/20)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Awards given are visible across all platforms&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

        Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we doing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve never felt more urgency or responsibility to fulfill our
        mission of bringing community and belonging to everyone in the world. The
        Solidarity Award is meant to complement the efforts of our users, moderators,
        and employees at Reddit by enabling community-wide charitable giving during
        a time of great need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Heads Up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The team at Reddit worked quickly to enable the Solidarity Award.
        As with all new things at this scale, we are keeping an eye out for any bugs
        and issues that may arise, and will update the experience accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Reddit to all of our users:&lt;/strong&gt; Stay
        safe, be vigilant, and take care of one another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Reddit
        is covering the transaction fees associated with the purchase of the Solidarity

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve participated
        in Reddit\u2019s April Fools\u2019 Day tradition before, you&amp;#39;ll know
        that this is the point where we normally share a confusing/cryptic message
        before pointing you toward some weird experience that we\u2019ve created for
        your enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While we still plan to do that, we think
        it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this year, things feel quite a bit
        different. The world is experiencing a moment of incredible uncertainty and
        stress; and throughout this time, it\u2019s become even more clear how valuable
        Reddit is to millions of people looking for community, a place to seek and
        share information, provide support to one another, or simply to escape the
        reality of our collective \u2018new normal.\u2019&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over
        the past 5 years at Reddit, April Fools\u2019 Day has emerged as a time for
        us to create and discover new things with our community (that\u2019s all of
        you). It&amp;#39;s also a chance for us to celebrate you. Reddit only succeeds
        because millions of humans come together each day to make this collective
        system work. We create a project each April Fools\u2019 Day to say thank you,
        and think it\u2019s important to continue that tradition this year too. We
        hope this year\u2019s experience will provide some insight and moments of
        delight during this strange and difficult time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With that
        said, as promised:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What makes
        you human?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you recognize it in
        others?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you sure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        looking for an opinion on anything \u2014 the most underrated TV show of the
        nineties; the very best drugstore mascara; the most athletic NFL player of
        all-time \u2014 there\u2019s no better place to get honest answers and gauge
        consensus, than on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, in an effort to elevate
        Reddit\u2019s diverse opinion-based content, we\u2019re excited to introduce
        Polls: a brand new post type that encourages redditors to share their opinion
        via voting. We\u2019ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the
        past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited
        to now release this post type to everyone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why
        Polls?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can sometimes be tough for new
        redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit, , and to feel a sense
        of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier
        will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite
        communities and engage in different ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s a
        look at some of our recent test polls&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/z45s3p889no41.png?width=2356&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cbd040f5e79e93b503c0a2d61378470c478e2305&quot;&gt;Viewing

        versions of Android that cause the app to crash for some redditors when they

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:
        Today we published our 2019&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency
        Report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I\u2019ll stick around to answer
        your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It\u2019s that time of year again when
        we share Reddit\u2019s annual transparency report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We share
        this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being
        managed by Reddit, and how it\u2019s both shared and not shared with government
        and non-government parties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll find information
        on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year,
        we\u2019ve expanded the report to include new data\u2014specifically, a breakdown
        of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals,
        and subreddit quarantines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;By the numbers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since
        the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019&quot;&gt;full
        report&lt;/a&gt; is rather long, I\u2019ll call out a few stats below:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADMIN REMOVALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;In 2019, we removed &lt;strong&gt;~53M&lt;/strong&gt; pieces of
        content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading
        and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track
        separately.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy&quot;&gt;Content
        Policy&lt;/a&gt; violations, we removed &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;222k&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;pieces of content&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;55.9k
        accounts&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21.9k&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;subreddits&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;87%&lt;/strong&gt;
        of which were removed for being unmoderated).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Additionally, we quarantined &lt;strong&gt;256 subreddits&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEGAL REMOVALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reddit received &lt;strong&gt;110 requests&lt;/strong&gt;
        from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with &lt;strong&gt;37.3%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;In 2019 we removed about &lt;strong&gt;5x more&lt;/strong&gt; content
        for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices
        for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already
        been removed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REQUESTS FOR USER
        INFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;We received a total
        of &lt;strong&gt;772 requests&lt;/strong&gt; for user account information
        from law enforcement and government entities. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;366&lt;/strong&gt;
        of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement
        (&lt;strong&gt;68%&lt;/strong&gt; of which we complied with).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;406&lt;/strong&gt;
        were non-emergency requests (&lt;strong&gt;73%&lt;/strong&gt; of which we
        complied with); most were US subpoenas.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reddit received
        an additional &lt;strong&gt;224 requests&lt;/strong&gt; to temporarily preserve
        certain user account information (&lt;strong&gt;86%&lt;/strong&gt; of which
        we complied with).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Note: We carefully
        review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If
        we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or
        reject it. (You can read more in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy&quot;&gt;Privacy
        Policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement&quot;&gt;Guidelines
        for Law Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;While I have
        your attention...&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I\u2019d like to share an update about
        our thinking around quarantined communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we &lt;a
        href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/&quot;&gt;expanded
        our quarantine policy&lt;/a&gt;, we created an appeals process for sanctioned
        communities. One of the goals was to \u201Cforce subscribers to reconsider
        their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.\u201D While the
        policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier
        rules and norms, it didn\u2019t address the role that each member plays in
        the health of their community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, we\u2019re making
        an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking
        content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed
        by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope
        this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;If you\u2019ve read this far&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to
        this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and
        if you like posts about what we\u2019re doing, you can stay up to date and
        talk to our teams in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/RedditSecurity&quot;&gt;r/RedditSecurity&lt;/a&gt;,

        and &lt;a href=&quot;/r/changelog&quot;&gt;r/changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As usual, I\u2019ll be sticking around to answer your
        questions in the comments. AMA.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update:
        I&amp;#39;m off for now. Thanks for questions, everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

        Today we launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/4xw2jtnwlqu31.png&quot;&gt;an
        Extra Life Award&lt;/a&gt; to help raise money and awareness for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extra-life.org/reddit&quot;&gt;Extra
        Life&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-hour gaming marathon charity benefiting Children&amp;#39;s
        Miracle Network Hospitals! This new award is available alongside Silver, Gold,
        and Platinum from now through Nov. 2, and Reddit will match the first $15,000
        of ALL Coins purchased during this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/coins/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase
        Coins today and help support children&amp;#39;s hospitals!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are a few details about the limited Extra Life Award:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The award costs 500 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/coins/&quot;&gt;Coins&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the
        same cost as the Gold award&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The recipient receives a
        week of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/premium&quot;&gt;Premium&lt;/a&gt;
        and 100 coins\u2014the same benefits as Gold!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Anyone
        who gives this award, I&amp;#39;m told, has a heart of gold! (And also a shiny,
        new trophy at a later date!)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reddit will match the first
        $15,000 of ALL Coin purchases from now through Nov. 2.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See the award here in all its snazziness:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dmj0sb/join_us_in_supporting_extra_life_a_24hour_gaming/&quot;&gt;we
        announced&lt;/a&gt; our 8th year partnering with Extra Life for our favorite
        annual tradition: playing &lt;del&gt;24&lt;/del&gt; 25 hours of video games
        to help raise money for sick kids. We&amp;#39;re not doing this alone! Thanks
        to some truly heroic redditors, we have already raised over $40,000 of our
        $150,000 goal!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, we recognize not everyone can relinquish
        the majority of their weekend to play video games (we totally had other plans,
        we swear). We made this award to make it easier for even more people to get
        involved and help support one of our favorite charity events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have
        the opposite problem? If your wallet is feeling thin, you can also help by
        signing up to fundraise! Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dmj0sb/join_us_in_supporting_extra_life_a_24hour_gaming/&quot;&gt;our

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminder: Extra Life Game Day is November 2nd!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On this coming Saturday a raiding party of staffers here at Reddit
        HQ will be streaming our fundraising efforts live on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/reddit&quot;&gt;Twitch
        stream&lt;/a&gt;. Tune in and join us for 25 hours of mind-melting gaming
        and delirious, sleep-deprived antics. From Fortnite to Untitled Goose Game,
        we&amp;#39;ll be playing a variety of games, so join us and you may even get
        to play head-to-head against an admin in your favorite game!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR is that we\u2019re
        updating our harassment and bullying policy so we can be more responsive to
        your reports. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We wanted
        to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy&quot;&gt;Content
        Policy&lt;/a&gt; regarding content that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully&quot;&gt;threatens,
        harasses, or bullies&lt;/a&gt;, which you can read in full &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we doing this?&lt;/strong&gt; These
        changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback
        we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem
        with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required
        a behavior to be \u201Ccontinued\u201D and/or \u201Csystematic\u201D for us
        to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar
        of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is
        an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn\u2019t clear that abuse toward
        both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant
        that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones,
        were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly,
        it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of
        the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes
        we\u2019re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give
        some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place
        for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of
        that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform.
        &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also hope that this change will take some of the burden
        off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against
        content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules
        against-- rules that we support and encourage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How
        will these changes work in practice?&lt;/strong&gt; We all know that context
        is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we\u2019re
        talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we\u2019re hoping today\u2019s
        changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously,
        we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we\u2019ll
        now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate
        some of the burden on the harassee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should also know
        that we\u2019ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to
        help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don\u2019t worry,
        machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won\u2019t
        be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report
        the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will
        still be made by a human admin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with any rule change,
        this will take some time to fully enforce. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/becbnx/hey_rchangelog_were_rolling_out_some_new/&quot;&gt;response
        times have improved significantly since the start of the year&lt;/a&gt;, but
        we\u2019re always striving to move faster. In the meantime, we encourage moderators
        to take this opportunity to examine their community rules and make sure that
        they are not creating an environment where bullying or harassment are tolerated
        or encouraged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do if I see
        content that I think breaks this rule?&lt;/strong&gt; As always, if you see
        or experience behavior that you believe is in violation of this rule, please
        use the report button [\u201CThis is abusive or harassing &amp;gt; \u201CIt\u2019s
        targeted harassment\u201D] to let us know. If you believe an entire user account
        or subreddit is dedicated to harassing or bullying behavior against an individual
        or group, we want to know that too; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/report&quot;&gt;report
        it to us here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks. As usual, we\u2019ll hang
        around for a bit and answer questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: typo. &lt;em&gt;Edit
        2: Thanks for your questions, we&amp;#39;re signing off for now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (9/4):&lt;/strong&gt;
        Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/eus5nc4?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&quot;&gt;announced
        below in the stickied comment&lt;/a&gt;! Thanks to all who participated!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed some new icons popping
        up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently\u2014these
        are &lt;strong&gt;Community Awards&lt;/strong&gt;! We started testing these
        in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/&quot;&gt;small
        alpha group back in April&lt;/a&gt; and expanded the group to include more
        volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As
        of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in
        their communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;What Are Community Awards?&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for
        redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names,
        and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced
        between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Community Awards will
        be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to
        Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=1928&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=735a9a37bb33c8d2139d9982cd68908c920ed19f&quot;&gt;A
        highly decorated post on r/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum,
        as well as the new Community Awards!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the above
        screenshot from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/&quot;&gt;r/DunderMifflin&lt;/a&gt;,
        you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are &lt;strong&gt;Community
        Awards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;What Are the Benefits of Community
        Awards?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation
        to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community
        Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the &lt;strong&gt;Community
        Bank&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this new update, 20% of Coins
        spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example,
        in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt;r/IAmA&lt;/a&gt;
        community if you give the \u201CStar of Excellence\u201D Award (2,000 Coins)
        to another user, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/&quot;&gt;r/IAmA&lt;/a&gt;
        automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mods
        can access the Community Bank to give\u2026&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Mod-Exclusive
        Awards&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive
        Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative
        of their community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from
        the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don\u2019t need to spend money
        to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also
        have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending
        on the Award price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mod-Award costing &lt;strong&gt;1,800
        Coins&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;1 month&lt;/strong&gt; of Reddit Premium&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Mod-Award costing &lt;strong&gt;5,400 Coins&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;3
        months&lt;/strong&gt; of Reddit Premium&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;\u2026 and so
        on!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s what Mod-Exclusive Awards
        look like on posts / comments:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a
        href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rek8d44u6bc31.png?width=300&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=56520aaebbfdee38fd9cb0f80bc6339924222e40&quot;&gt;This
        example shows the coveted Golden Toaster Award, which you can view in a larger
        size by hovering over the icon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Which Communities
        Are Eligible for Community Awards?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Community Awards are
        available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now?&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check
        out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/chdxkh/community_awards_creating_new_awards_for_users/&quot;&gt;our
        companion post on r/modnews&lt;/a&gt; for all the details on how mods can
        create Awards!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to seeing all your
        creativity with these new Awards, but &lt;strong&gt;please do note these important
        considerations&lt;/strong&gt; when creating Awards:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;They
        must comply with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy&quot;&gt;Reddit\u2019s
        Content Policy&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They must not violate intellectual
        property rights of others; and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They must be SFW.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs
        already, but now that they&amp;#39;re available to more mod teams, we\u2019re
        seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Participating is pretty simple: &lt;strong&gt;If you are a mod, create
        an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your
        community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.&lt;/strong&gt;
        For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community&amp;#39;s
        Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit (2019/11/26): This
        feature has been delayed until 2020&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit (2020/03/30):
        We released a feature where you will get a push notification when you get
        a new follower. If you have your push notifications enabled on our mobile
        apps, or desktop notifications enabled, you should receive one. We are working
        on expanding this feature to all users, even without push notifications. The
        follower list is still delayed until later this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hi
        everyone,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We collect a lot of feedback from you all, and
        one theme we\u2019ve heard consistently from users is that many of you want
        more visibility when users follow you. As we move the new profiles out of
        beta, we wanted to share a transparency change we are making. In the coming
        months, we will allow people to see which users follow them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We
        know that this may be a change from existing expectations, so we want to give
        you time to update your settings before moving forward with this. In the immediate
        future (starting Aug 19th, 2019), this will only affect new follows made.
        In about 3 months, we will make it possible to see your full list of followers.
        This would include follows made while profiles were in beta.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We
        plan to send a PM to all affected users, but wanted to make this public post
        as well so that you aren\u2019t surprised when you receive it. To be clear,
        the usernames will only be visible to the user who was followed. No one will
        be able to look up your full list of subscriptions/follows and no one else
        will be able to see a list of followers of a profile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If
        you are someone who follows other users, please take a second to examine your
        subscription/follow list and make sure you are comfortable with those users
        being aware that you follow them. If you are someone who has followers, we
        will make another post when the ability to view your followers has been released.
        We\u2019ll stick around in the comments for a bit if you have questions. If
        there are other features you\u2019d like to see for profiles, please let us
        know!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: updated 8/29 to
        Aug 29th, 2019 as it&amp;#39;s a more clear date format&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit:

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello hello,&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve made some changes to Multireddits that we\u2019d like
        to share with you. Also, a fun contest! Let\u2019s get to it...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;What\u2019s New&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Name: Multireddits
        \u2192 Custom Feeds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Multireddits have been around
        a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/&quot;&gt;long
        time&lt;/a&gt;. They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable
        feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they
        haven\u2019t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be
        changing the name from Multireddits to \u201CCustom Feeds.\u201D Sometimes
        simple is better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More Support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom
        Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities
        from them, duplicate other redditors&amp;#39; feeds, and change the privacy
        settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit.
        We\u2019ll be adding support for Custom Feeds on Android in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/jox6inka4my21.png?width=3360&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c92d7268dbcd46b35d6d2380b8316d4471dc1aac&quot;&gt;iOS
        Screenshot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Follow Functionality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can now follow another redditor\u2019s Custom Feed (as long as
        it\u2019s set to Public). This means that when you follow a feed it will appear
        on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another
        community to the feed, you\u2019ll see that update the next time you open
        the feed. This will be super useful for communities that want to keep a running
        feed of related communities, or for folks that have a specific ever-evolving
        interest that they want to share with others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/a6ztwd2b4my21.png?width=3360&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4576c32bf987c0dadf6a41024134387f96b45fb4&quot;&gt;Follow
        on new Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improved Sharing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve made some tweaks to the URL structure of your Custom Feed
        so that it\u2019s easier to share with others. No more accidentally sharing
        a URL with /me/ in it that won\u2019t work for anyone else. We\u2019ve also
        created a new privacy category for public custom feeds, Hidden, that can be
        accessed by anyone with the link but will not show up on your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now have spaces
        in the name of your Custom Feed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/Wyt6sLEjKjaFjzybth/giphy.gif&quot;&gt;Enough
        said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mix and Match&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Follow a mix of communities and profiles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coming
        Soon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the near future communities will be
        able to create Custom Feeds that are owned by the community, rather than an
        individual. This will also support turning the Related Communities sidebar
        widget into a feed. We are also going to be building ways for you to see popular
        and trending Custom Feeds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Contest&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We
        are investing in this feature because we believe redditors are great at finding
        niche communities and we want more people to discover all of the unique communities
        that we have. Now for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/30LbRh69K3fO/giphy.gif&quot;&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;
        part! We are holding a one-week contest for the best Custom Feeds created
        by redditors. The winners will receive Coins and bragging rights.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To submit your Custom Feed, reply to the top-level sticky comment
        with a link to your Custom Feed and the category it best fits under. &lt;strong&gt;It
        must be public.&lt;/strong&gt; Please only submit one feed per category.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are the categories that we will award winners from:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Aww&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Artist Resources&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Beauty&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Books &amp;amp; Writing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cool
        Pictures (images only)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discussion (text only)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Fashion&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Food &amp;amp; Cooking&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Health
        &amp;amp; Fitness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Music&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Parenting&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Quirky&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sports&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Travel&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Wholesome&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;We\u2019ll be picking
        winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has, how
        many upvotes their comment entry has, and our internal voting. Winners will
        be announced in a follow-up post next week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some
        custom feeds to get you started (many of which are mine):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;

        SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today
        we\u2019ve posted our latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018&quot;&gt;Transparency
        Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The purpose of the report is to share
        information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove
        content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right
        to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not
        shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve
        included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and
        from private parties from within the United States. The most common types
        of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests.
        In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information
        from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents
        a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object
        when appropriate, and we didn\u2019t disclose any information for 23% of the
        requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for
        the production of user account information and did not comply with any of
        those requests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, we expanded the report to included
        details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at
        Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions).
        We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits
        often have additional rules specific to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cc.gatech.edu/%7Esjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf&quot;&gt;purpose,
        tone, and norms of their community&lt;/a&gt;. You can now see the breakdown
        of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community
        actions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other news, you may have heard that we closed
        an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will
        help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you?
        Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And\u2014of course\u2014we
        do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll
        hang around for a while to answer your questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\u2013Steve&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;edit: Thanks for the silver you cheap
        bastards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;update: I&amp;#39;m out for now. Will check back
        later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32;
